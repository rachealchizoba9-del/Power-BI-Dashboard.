# Life Expectancy Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive Life Expectancy Dashboard built in Power BI.
The dashboard analyzes global health indicators and helps users understand how different countries compare in terms of:

•	 Life expectancy

•	Health expenditure

•	Mortality rates

•	Disease cases (Measles, Hepatitis B, HIV/AIDS)

The dashboard provides a clean and simple visual story that highlights key global health patterns.


# Data Source
## The dataset includes:

•	Country

•	Life Expectancy

•	Total Expenditure

•	Adult Mortality

•	Infant Deaths

•	Under-Five Deaths

•	Measles Cases

•	Hepatitis B Levels

•	HIV/AIDS

•GDP


# 📈 Dashboard Components
## 1. KPI Summary Cards
### The top section of the dashboard displays summarized global values for:

•	Adult Mortality

•	Infant Deaths

•	Hepatitis B

•	Measles Cases

•	HIV/AIDS

•	Under-Five Deaths

•	Number of Countries

These KPIs provide a quick, high-level overview of worldwide health performance.

## 2. Life Expectancy, Health Expenditure & Country Status (Table)
### This table now includes:

•	Life Expectancy.

•	Total Health Expenditure.

•	Status (Developing or Developed Country).

Adding the Status field helps users:
Compare developed vs developing countries,
See differences in spending patterns.

Understand how a country’s development status influences life expectancy.


## 3. Top 10 Countries with the Highest Life Expectancy.
### This section highlights:

•	Countries with the highest life expectancy.

•	Differences in expenditure and mortality patterns among those leading countries.


## 4. Top 10 Countries with the Highest Gross Domestic Product.
### This section highlight:
•	The top 10 countries ranked by GDP

• The economic output of each country in

•Global economic leaders and disparities among the top economies





## 🎯Purpose of the Dashboard
### The dashboard was created to:

•	Show global variations in life expectancy.

•	Reveal how mortality and expenditure indicators differ across countries.

•	Support data-driven insights and academic analysis.

•	Present a clear visual summary for easy interpretation.


## 🛠Tools & Technologies Used.

•	Power BI Desktop – for dashboard visualization.

•	Excel – for storing and preparing the dataset.

•	SQL – used to query, clean, and prepare the data before importing into Power BI.
